PROJECT TITLE: html_generator    
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Create a website 
VERSION or DATE: 10/01/2018
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run the BlueJ project file
AUTHORS: Ioannis Chantolios
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Once running BlueJ open the project. Following that in the UI
you will see the HtmlDocument class. Right click on the HtmlDocument will give
a dropdown menu on which should click on newHtmlDocument. This will produce a new object
apprearing at the bottom of the BlueJ window, on which a double click will give a 
dropdown menu on which we select create(). This will popup a new window desplaying 
our website fields, then we can save this as an html file in the same directory by 
using save() in the same dropdown menu of the object. Finally we can double check
wheather the program is working correctly by searching in the directory of our project
for a icon look alike our defult web browser with the name of the actor and with an
html extension.
